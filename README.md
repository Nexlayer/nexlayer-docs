#Nexlayer Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation repo for **[Nexlayer](https://nexlayer.com)** ‚Äî the AI-native cloud that turns code or prompts into scalable, production-grade applications in seconds.

This repo powers [docs.nexlayer.com](https://docs.nexlayer.com), our static documentation site built for developers, agents, and teams launching the next generation of AI-native software.

## üß† What Is Nexlayer?

Nexlayer is a zero-friction deployment cloud designed for:

- üõ†Ô∏è **Builders & Indie Devs** who want to ship fast  
- ü§ñ **AI Agents** that generate and deploy code autonomously  
- üöÄ **Startups** that need real infra, not DevOps overhead  

It abstracts away infrastructure complexity so you can focus on shipping ‚Äî not configuring.

Deploy full-stack apps from code, YAML, or prompt. Nexlayer handles the rest: builds, secrets, scaling, DNS, TLS, networking, and service discovery (`<pod>.pod`) out of the box.
