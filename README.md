# 📚 Nexlayer Documentation

Welcome to Nexlayer - the AI-powered cloud platform that autonomously deploys, scales, and operates modern applications instantly, without infrastructure overhead.

## 🎯 Our Vision

AuditDeploy Inc. is an applied research lab automating technology deployment. Our mission is to build the cloud architect of the future—an AI agent system that's an order of magnitude more effective than any cloud engineer or DevOps team.

We call it the AI deployer—an intelligent agent that turns any codebase into a live, scalable product in seconds. With AI as your deployment partner, you'll move at the speed of intuition—even across the most complex systems.

This new generation of engineers won't just write code—they'll launch entire products with it. They'll architect, ship, and scale infrastructure without ever touching a terminal.
