## The YAML Building Blocks

The YAML file is like a blueprint for your app. It tells Nexlayer what to run and how to set it up.

### Basic Structure:

```
application:
  name: "my-ai-app"
  url: "www.myapp.com" # optional
  pods:
    - name: web
      image: "your-username/my-app:v1"
      servicePorts:
        - 80
```

### Required Fields

* `name`: A unique name for your app
* `pods`: The list of containers that make up your app

Each pod needs:

* `name`: Lowercase, unique identifier
* `image`: Hosted Docker image
* `servicePorts`: At least one port

### Optional but Helpful

* `url`: For permanent production apps
* `path`: Route path for the web pod (e.g., "/")
* `vars`: Environment variables
* `volumes`: Persistent storage
* `secrets`: For API keys and credentials

---

## Connecting Your App Pieces

Pods communicate using `<pod-name>.pod`. For example:

```yaml
vars:
  API_URL: "http://backend.pod:8000"
```

No need to configure IPs or DNS‚ÄîNexlayer handles it.

---

## Saving Data (So It Doesn't Disappear)

Use `volumes` to persist data between restarts.

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: my-data
    size: "1Gi"
    mountPath: "/data"
```

### Postgres Tip

Bad setup:

```yaml
mountPath: "/var/lib/postgresql/data"
# PGDATA missing
```

Best setup:

```yaml
mountPath: "/var/lib/postgresql"
vars:
  PGDATA: "/var/lib/postgresql/data"
```

This ensures Postgres runs reliably.

---

## Keeping Secrets Safe (Like API Keys)

```yaml
secrets:
  - name: my-key
    data: "my-super-secret-key"
    mountPath: "/var/secrets"
    fileName: "key.txt"
```

Read the secret in your app:

```python
with open('/var/secrets/key.txt', 'r') as f:
    api_key = f.read().strip()
```

---

## Using Your Own Images

### Pre-reqs for Public Images

Before using your own public Docker image with Nexlayer, make sure you:

1. ‚úÖ Have Docker Desktop running
2. ‚úÖ Build for Linux/x86\_64 platform:

```bash
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t your-image-name .
```

3. ‚úÖ Push your image to a public registry:

#### Options:

* **TTL.sh (temporary, perfect for quick previews)**

```yaml
image: "ttl.sh/my-app-name:1h"
```

* **Docker Hub (public user repository)**

```yaml
image: "docker-username/my-app:v1"
```

* **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR.io)**

```yaml
image: "ghcr.io/your-username/my-app:v1"
```

---

### Public

```yaml
image: "your-username/my-app:v1"
```

### Private

```yaml
application:
  registryLogin:
    registry: "ghcr.io"
    username: "your-username"
    personalAccessToken: "your-token"
```

---

## Adding AI Models (Self-Hosted or API)

### Self-Hosted

```yaml
- name: ollama
  image: "ollama/ollama:latest"
  servicePorts:
    - 11434
  volumes:
    - name: ollama-data
      size: "5Gi"
      mountPath: "/root/.ollama"
```

### API-Only

```yaml
vars:
  OPENAI_API_KEY: "<% SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY %>"
secrets:
  - name: openai-key
    data: "your-openai-key-here"
    mountPath: "/var/secrets"
    fileName: "key.txt"
```

---

## Quick Tips to Avoid OOPS Moments

* Always start with `application:`
* Pod names must be unique and lowercase
* Every pod needs `servicePorts`
* Use `<pod-name>.pod` for internal communication
* Set `PGDATA` properly for Postgres

## ‚úÖ Example: The AI-Powered Web App

### From Hello World to Production in 4 Steps

Our AI-native cloud platform handles everything automatically, so you can focus on shipping delightful products users love.

---

### Step 1 ‚Äî Deploy Your Frontend

**Tech:** Next.js 15 + Tailwind + App Router
Start with a modern frontend. Deploy your static or server-rendered Next.js site in seconds.

```yaml
application:
  name: "nexlayer-app" # Required: Globally unique app name
  pods:
    - name: prisma  # üîÑ Prisma ORM ‚Äî type-safe database access layer
      image: "user-name/prisma:latest" # Public image ‚Äî Nexlayer pulls this from Docker Hub
      vars:
        DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://postgres:password@database.pod:5432/mydb"
```

---

### Step 2 ‚Äî Add Auth + Database

**Tech:** Supabase (Auth + PostgreSQL)
Add real users and persistent data using Supabase. Easily store accounts, profiles, and content.

```yaml
pods:
  - name: db
    image: "postgres:14"
    servicePorts:
      - 5432
    vars:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass
      POSTGRES_DB: appdb
```

---

### Step 3 ‚Äî Use Prisma for Data Logic

**Tech:** Prisma ORM
Auto-generate your API with Prisma and define your database schema using elegant TypeScript models.

```yaml
pods:
  - name: api
    image: "ttl.sh/my-backend:1h"
    path: /api
    servicePorts:
      - 4000
    vars:
      DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://user:pass@db.pod:5432/appdb"
```

---

### Step 4 ‚Äî Plug in OpenAI

**Tech:** OpenAI API
Let your users ask questions, summarize notes, or chat with their data ‚Äî right inside your app.

```yaml
pods:
  - name: openai
    # ü§ñ OpenAI API wrapper (proxy or backend integration)
    image: "user-name/openai:latest"
    servicePorts:
      - 3000
    vars:
      OPENAI_API_KEY_PATH: "/var/secrets/openai/key.txt"
    secrets:
      - name: openai-key
        data: "sk-......"
        mountPath: "/var/secrets/openai"
        fileName: key.txt
```

      secrets:
        - name: openai-key
          data: "sk-..."  # Your real OpenAI API key goes here
          mountPath: "/var/secrets/openai"
          fileName: "key.txt"  # File name used inside the container
```

**Prebuilt:** Next.js frontend, Supabase auth, PostgreSQL DB, Prisma backend, and OpenAI agent ‚Äî all live in minutes.

### üöÄ Scenario: From Local Game Dev to Global Launch

Let's say you've just built a sick frontend using **Next.js**, **Tailwind**, **shadcn/ui**, and **Framer Motion**. Or maybe you whipped up an **HTML5 browser game** with just JS and CSS, and it runs beautifully in the browser.

You got it working locally thanks to your favorite tools like **Cursor** or **Windsurf**.

It's time to level up ‚Äî not just share screen recordings on social, but make it a **real product people can use and share** anywhere in the world.

Here's how to go live fast with Nexlayer:

### üåç Let's Deploy to Nexlayer
1. **Make sure Docker Desktop is running**  
   This lets you build your container image.

2. **Create a `Dockerfile`** for your frontend or game:

3. **Build and push your image** to a public registry (like TTL.sh)

4. **Get Nexlayer‚Äôs schema** to help create your YAML:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://app.nexlayer.io/schema"
    ```

5. **Create a file called `nexlayer.yaml`**, and paste the structure returned from the schema. Then update your image name:

    ```yaml
    application:
      name: "my-game"
      pods:
        - name: web
          image: "ttl.sh/my-awesome-game:1h"
          servicePorts:
            - 3000
    ```

6. **Deploy it using curl**:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://app.nexlayer.io/startUserDeployment" \
      -H "Content-Type: text/x-yaml" \
      --data-binary @nexlayer.yaml
    ```

7. **üéâ Done!** You‚Äôll get a live URL instantly.
