# ü¶æ What Is Nexlayer?

Nexlayer is an **AI‚Äëpowered cloud** that abstracts away all infrastructure complexity. You decide what to launch, and Nexlayer automatically:

1. **Provisions** compute resources, networking, storage, DNS, and persistent volumes  
2. **Deploys** your app via YAML, our CLI, Web UI, or AI agents  
3. **Auto‚Äëdiscovers** and wires up all services without manual configuration  
4. **Auto‚Äëscales** with traffic‚Äîno manual intervention  
5. **Manages** secrets, resource allocation, and TLS certificates  
6. **Provides** instant previews (2¬†hr) or permanent custom domains
