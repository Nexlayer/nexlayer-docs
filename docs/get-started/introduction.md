## 💡 Why Nexlayer?

Because the hard parts of cloud infrastructure shouldn't slow you down.

Nexlayer automates everything behind the scenes:

- 🛠️ **Builds** your containers from code or prompts  
- 🔐 **Secures** your app with TLS, secrets, and env vars  
- 🌐 **Connects** all your services with zero config  
- 🚀 **Scales** instantly as traffic grows  
- 🔎 **Discovers** services like magic (`<pod-name>.pod`)  
- ⚡ **Deploys** from CLI, Web UI, API, or AI agents

You bring the idea — Nexlayer handles the cloud.

## 🧪 What can I deploy?

Anything from:

- A simple “Hello World” web page  
- A fullstack app with frontend, backend, and database  
- An AI-powered app with vector DBs and OpenAI APIs  
- A product MVP built entirely in an AI code editor  
- Your AI agent's next-generation toolchain

Nexlayer is production-grade, AI-friendly, and designed for helping you go from mvp to scalable product in minutes. Saving you time, complexity and money.

## 🧰 You don’t need to understand YAML — but it’s there when you’re ready

Most users never even touch `nexlayer.yaml`.  
But if you want to take control — define your app structure, scale out pods, and wire up multi-service backends — it’s just a single file.

One config. Full stack. Live URL.
